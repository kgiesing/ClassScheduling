At the command line when running the program:

-There should be 3 files of input, one for the list of rooms, one for the list of professors, and one for the list of courses.
--These filenames must be entered all together, in this order, on the command line.
-Each entry in any one of these lists should be on its own line.
-The delimiter that separates the fields of each entry on each list is by default a comma (",").
--To change the delimiter to some newDelimiter, "-d newDelimiter" can be entered on the command line BEFORE the filenames.
-The output file of the resulting schedule is by default "schedule.txt".
--To change the file to some outputFile, "-o outputFile" can be entered on the command line before or after the filenames (but not in the middle of them).

Below is how each room, professor, and course should be listed on each line, with their fields listed from left to right:

-Rooms: Each room has a room ID and a max capacity (2 fields: string, int).
-Professors: Each professor has a professor ID, a first name and a last name (3 fields: string, string, string).
-Courses: Each course has a course ID, a name, a professor ID matching who's teaching it, the number of enrolled students, how many times the class meets per week, and a list of conflicting courses (by ID) (5+ fields for the whole line: string, string, string, int, int, {string, string ...}).

The output is as follows:

-The schedule is partitioned by every weekday and time of day combination, in a natural order.
-For every weekday and time of day, all the courses meeting at that time are listed, one course per line.
--Each line has the course name, the room ID, the professor teaching it, the number of enrolled student, and the room's capacity, separated by the delimiter.
