At the command line when running the program:

-There should be 3 files of input, one for the list of rooms, one for the list of professors, and one for the list of courses.
--These filenames must be entered all together, in this order, on the command line.
-Each entry in any one of these lists should be on its own line.
-The delimiter that separates the fields of each entry on each list is by default a comma (",").
--To change the delimiter to some newDelimiter, "-d newDelimiter" can be entered on the command line BEFORE the filenames.
-The output file of the resulting schedule is by default "schedule.txt".
--To change the file to some outputFile, "-o outputFile" can be entered on the command line before or after the filenames (but not in the middle of them).

Below is how each room, professor, and course should be listed on each line, with their fields listed from left to right.

-Rooms: Each room has a room ID and a max capacity (2 fields: string, int).
-Professors: Each professor has a professor ID, a first name and a last name (3 fields: string, string, string).
-Courses: Each course has a course ID, a name, a professor ID matching who's teaching it, the number of enrolled students, and a list of conflicting courses (by ID) (4+ fields: string, string, string, int, {string, string ...}).
