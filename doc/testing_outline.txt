All of these should have accompanying test methods.

-Reading files
--What happens when files are out of order on command line call
--What happens when a filename is broken
--What happens when data is improperly formatted on any one of the readers

-Writing schedule
--Ensure weekdays and timeblocks are correctly outputted with overidden <<
--Ensure all parts of each course output work

-General input
--What happens when any of rooms, courses, professor vectors are empty?
--What happens when rooms * weekdays * times < courses (not enough spots to schedule all courses)?

-Score Calculator (both Linear and Weighted)
--Draw up some test cases simple enough (but not trivial) to do the score calculation by hand.
--Actually simulate and check the score calculator works.

-System Test
--All of the constraints in the Project Agreement must be properly enforced.
